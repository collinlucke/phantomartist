# PhantomArtist

<sub>(yes, I too want to read it as "Philanthropist" every time I look at it)</sub>

So, the initial goal of this was to make a sort of "joke" library. The gag was that each component
would require configuring so many props, you'd be better of just creating your own components.
Hilarious, right?

Anyway...

I started using it with another `project` and so now I'm more concerned with creating the
functionality for that.

Please note that this is still super rough... SUPER rough

...maybe someday.

### On the roadmap

- Clean up `baseStyles` - add them to `baseTheme`
- Introduce accessibility
- Maybe change the name `phantomartist`
